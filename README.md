# Grove - A Decision Tree Training Algorithm Built with Python
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a decision tree training algorithm in Python. The algorithm aims to create an accurate and interpretable model for classification and regression tasks.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a decision tree training algorithm using Python that would serce as the base bulding block for an upcoming Random Forest algorithm implementation. Decision trees are widely used in machine learning due to their interpretability and ability to handle both categorical and numerical features. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of decision tree algorithms and their practical implementation by implemententing a decision tree training algorithm from scratch and analyzing its performance on a variety of datasets.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment using `pyenv`, `venv` or any other tool of your choice. Although the project was build using 3.10.2, it can probably run with older/newers versions, but tests weren't performed to confirm this.
2. Activate your environment
3. Install the project dependencies via pip `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
