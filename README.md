# Grove - Random Forests & Decision Trees Training Algorithms Built with Python
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a random forest & decision tree training algorithms implemented in Python. The algorithms aim to create an accurate and interpretable model for classification and regression tasks.

## Introduction
This repostiroty contains the source code for my thesis on the topic "DEVELOPMENT OF A RANDOM FOREST TRAINING ALGORITHM". This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the random forest training algorithm and its practicality by implemententing the algorithm from scratch and analyzing its performance on a variety of datasets.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment using `pyenv`, `venv` or any other tool of your choice. Although the project was build using 3.10.2, it can probably run with older/newers versions, but tests weren't performed to confirm this.
2. Activate your environment
3. Install the project dependencies via pip `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
